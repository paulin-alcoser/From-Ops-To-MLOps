# From-Ops-To-MLOps
This repository tells my ongoing journey of going from DevOps to MLOps

### Step 1: Learning Machine Learning Fundamentals
My plan is to start by reading the following books and write a weekly summary of the main takeaways of the chapters I read:
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron
- Mathematics for Machine Learning" by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong
