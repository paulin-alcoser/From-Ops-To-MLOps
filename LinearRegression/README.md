# Linear Regression

This repository contains code and information related to linear regression, a fundamental concept in machine learning and statistical modeling. It includes theoretical knowledge from Andrew Ng's course at Stanford CS229, as well as a code implementation of linear regression from scratch. Additionally, it provides insights into real-life scenarios where linear regression is applicable and guidelines on when to use it.

## Theoretical Knowledge

The theoretical knowledge in this repository is based on Andrew Ng's course on machine learning, specifically Lecture 2: [Linear Regression with One Variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b4MUYve_U8&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&index=2).

## Code Implementation

The code for linear regression is implemented from scratch and can be found in the [linear_regression.py](linear_regression.py) file in this repository. It demonstrates the step-by-step process of implementing linear regression using Python, without relying on external libraries.

## Real-Life Scenarios

Linear regression is widely used in various real-life scenarios, such as:

- Predicting housing prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, etc.
- Forecasting sales based on advertising expenditure.
- Estimating the impact of factors like age, education, and experience on salary.

In these scenarios, linear regression provides a simple yet effective way to model relationships between variables and make predictions.

## When to Use Linear Regression

Linear regression is suitable in the following situations:

- When the relationship between the input and output variables appears to be linear.
- When there is a need for interpretability and understanding the impact of individual features.
- When working with a small dataset with limited features.
- When the assumptions of linear regression (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, etc.) are reasonably met.

Understanding the context and characteristics of the data is crucial in determining whether linear regression is an appropriate choice.
